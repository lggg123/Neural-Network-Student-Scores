## Here is an example neural network calculates the accuracy of our prediction for exam scores and sees the error. Overall the accuracy was 95% and the test set size 20%.

### To run the code simply type in the terminal ruby neural.rb

### Output should be something like this
`Max epochs     5000. Desired error: 0.0099999998.
Epochs            1. Current error: 0.2488013208. Bit fail 80.
Epochs          434. Current error: 0.0099001098. Bit fail 1.
Algorithm predicted class: [1]
Accuracy: 95.0% - test set of size 20.0%
